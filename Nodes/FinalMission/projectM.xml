<file path="Project_M" name="Project_M.docx">Project M - Matrix
Matrix, a project founded by Z3r0 and Morpheus, in conjunction with the United Federation Government.
Matrix's goal was to enable ease of surveillance in all computers. Every model and OS since computers were first invented.</file>

<file path="Project_M" name="Government_Influence.docx">The United Federation Government poured many resources into making this project a reality. They invested in many programmers to aid Z3r0 and Morpheus in their goal.
However, soon the United Federation demanded too much of the development team. So Z3r0 and Morpheus decided to eliminate them from this project.</file>

<file path="Project_M" name="Morpheus_Downfall.docx">After the creation of hellSec, Morpheus lost his trust in Z3r0. Z3r0 sent one of his own agents to steal from Morpheus, and Morpheus couldn't have that.
Morpheus directly attacked two of Z3r0's accomplices, and thus a war between the two began. It was not long after that until Z3r0 eliminated Morpheus for good.</file>

<file path="Project_M" name="Project_M_Now.docx">Project M continues stronger as ever, with only myself, Z3r0, at the helm of this project. My goal is no longer surveillance, however. It is infiltration.
Infiltration of every single computer on this Earth. The entire world at my fingertips.</file>
