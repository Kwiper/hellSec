  <posting title="Durtis Hates Computers!">
As said by the Holy Dible of Durtis, "Thou shalt not partake in otherworldly matters."
These fandangled computery things ARE OTHERWORLDLY. THEY'RE LIKE GATEWAYS INTO THE SOUL FOR THEM ALIENS TO LOOK INTO OUR MINDS.
JOIN ME, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IN PRAYING FOR THE COMPUTERS TO GO AWAY.
