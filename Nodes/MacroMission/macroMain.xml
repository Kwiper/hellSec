We are number one, hey!
We are number one
Now, listen closely

Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down in history
If you wanna be a villain number one
You have to chase a superhero on the run

Just follow my moves and sneak around
Be careful not to make a sound, shh
No! Don't touch that!

We are number one, hey!
We are number one
We are number one

Ha, ha, ha! Now, look at this net that I just found
When I say: "Go", be ready to throw. Go!
Throw it at him, not me!
Oh! Let's try something else

Now watch and learn, here's the deal
He'll slip and slide on this banana peel, ha, ha, ha!
What are you doing?!

Hey!

Ba, ba-biddly-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, we are number one, hey!
Ba, ba-biddly-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Villain number one!

Hey!

Hey! Ba, ba-biddly-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, we are number one, hey!
Ba, ba-biddly-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba

We are number one
We are number one
We are number one, hey, hey!</file>
