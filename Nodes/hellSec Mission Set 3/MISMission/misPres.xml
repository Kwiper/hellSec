<file path="home" name="TheoryOfUniverse.docx">Our whole Universe was in a hot, dense state 
Then nearly 14 billion years ago, expansion started... Wait.

Neanderthals developed tools 
We built a wall
We built the pyramids!
Math, science, history
Unravelling the mysteries
That all started with a Big Bang.
BANG!</file>
