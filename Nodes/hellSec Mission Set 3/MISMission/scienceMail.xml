Hey, Dr. Hawkins, thank you for your email. 
Unfortunately we cannot give you the IP to our presentation server as we must keep it secured, however I can link you to our university server.

Hello, Dave from MIS. This is Stephen Hawkins.

I am writing this email to request access to your presentation server. I am afraid that my presentation may not have made it to MIS properly.

Thank you,
-Stephen Hawkins, PhD, MS, BS, AS.
