Fellow acolytes,
Our plans are moving along swiftly. For those who have not done so, please join our mission server.
------------------------------------------
>I don't have access to the server
------------------------------------------
Then how did you get access to this board? All followers of Giygas get access to every single server on the network
------------------------------------------
I fucking lost the ip, savvy?
------------------------------------------

No matter, disciple, you seem like you love our Embodiment with all your heart. I'm afraid there is no way I can give you access to the server directly. You will have to go through the Cosmic Trials.
------------------------------------------
Damn, then how do I access these trials?
