<subject>Z3r0 Hour - Conclusion</subject>
<body>This... this is sick.
I can't believe Z3r0 would be a part of something like this. I know, our job requires us to have illegal access to computers but this... Takes it to another level.
With this Z3r0 could steal government secrets within seconds. He could bring down the entire world with this one project.
This is it. We have to stop Z3r0. Come back to hellSec. It's time for a much needed talk.</body>
