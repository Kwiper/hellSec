<posting title="#Z3r0 Hour# [PRIVATE]">
I had a huge feeling there was something wrong Z3r0 was hiding. And I think I've found it.
After doing some digging around, I found Z3r0's network. It seems like a very complicated network, and I can't do this on my own.
This is very important, and it could go towards proving Z3r0's guilt about something. I don't know what, but I know he's hiding something.</posting>

<body>Thank you for doing this, #PLAYERNAME#.
So for a while now, I've been scouting Z3r0 on my own, and I think I finally found something worth investigating.
However, I can't hack it on my own, which is why I asked you. I trust you, #PLAYERNAME# and I know this is our only chance to find out what Z3r0 is up to once and for all.
I've found two gateway nodes that seem to link to Z3r0's network. I'll let you handle one, let me know when you find anything interesting.
