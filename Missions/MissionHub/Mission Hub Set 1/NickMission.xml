Someone has uncovered some... information regarding hellSec and its motives that we wouldn't want out in the open.
We want you to delete all trace of this evidence.

<body>Hey,
This guy named Nick Smith has uncovered some information regarding our little faction and I want you to remove all evidence of it.
Delete any file you find that has the name "hellSec" in the title, and BE THOROUGH.
We don't want this information going out to the public just yet.

Watch out for proxies, too.

Good luck,
-Z3r0
