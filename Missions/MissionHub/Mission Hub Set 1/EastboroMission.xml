A church called the Eastboro Durtist Church has made headlines recently because of their bold statements and outlandish claims.
We want you to mess with their website.

<body>This is frankly one of the most ridiculous missions ever.
There's this church called the Eastboro Durtist Church. It's infamous for making very... interesting statements. I'll let you see them for yourself.
We want you to mess with their site just a bit. Replace every zero that appears in their x-server.sys file with "DICKS" exactly as it appears.

Have fun,
-Z3r0
