<body>Alright, here's the deal.
There's a popular pet shop that's been gaining a lot of media attention lately. Basically, they've been treating their animals poorly.
We decided to do something about it before anyone else.

We want you to find your way into the pet shop's security system and find a way to shut it down.

Good luck,
