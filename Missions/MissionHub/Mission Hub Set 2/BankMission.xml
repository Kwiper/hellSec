<body>Here's the deal.
The Commercial Bank of the UFA has reported someone exploiting their system and breaking in. They have discreetly asked us to investigate it.
The hacker did well to cover his tracks, but I know someone who has the tools we need to help with that.
Your mission is to find out who performed this hack, and navigate your way through their system to delete the account data they stole.
The bank has agreed to provide us with access to the bank's admin password, to make your investigation easier.

Good luck,
