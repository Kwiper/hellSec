    <body>I need your help.
You know the port crusher Quartz keeps asking me about? I'm having trouble getting it. Lots of trouble.
My associate who owns this port crusher calls himself Morpheus. I need you to hack into Morpheus' system and find a way to get the port crusher.
It's a program designed to crack the SSL port, or HTTPS. 
Once you find it, upload it to the drop server.
Be careful, Morpheus is not one to mess with.
