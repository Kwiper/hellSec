<body>Ok.
There's this script kiddie who's been annoying us a lot lately. He must be new to this, because we tracked him to his home server.
His name is Thomas Nanderson, and we want you to teach him a lesson in who not to mess with. From the looks of things, he's still a student, so why don't we change all the A's he has into F's.
