<body>Be careful with this one.
While what we are doing isn't really considered legal, this mission really pushes that boundary.
A reliable source of mine has informed me that the federal government is hiding something that could change the world for the worse, something called Project: M.
Your mission is to infiltrate the government and scout for any traces of this project. 
If you find anything related to this "Project: M," DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY.
Remember to cover your tracks well. We don't want the government to track you down.

Good luck,
