<body>#PLAYERNAME#,
As a huge fan of the show Professor What, a show about a man who travels with people all around time and space in a suitcase that's bigger on the inside, I feel this mission is more of a personal request.
That said, your mission is as follows: Infiltrate the EBC servers and try to find a script for the season 10 finale episode of Professor What.
Once you manage to download a copy, upload it to the drop server.

Good luck,
