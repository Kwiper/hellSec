<body>Hey, #PLAYERNAME#
Z3r0 already briefed me on this mission. We're gonna team up to take down Morpheus. Z3r0 has gotten sick of Morpheus throwing us around, so it's time we got payback.
Basically, Moprheus' system runs from a core server. We take that down, we take down Morpheus. Z3r0 provided me with two access points we could start with. I'll break into one, you break into the other.

Good luck,
-H3l1x
