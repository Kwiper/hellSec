A WeTuber by the name of Grumplestiltskin has some harrowing videos about the hacker community. We've even been mentioned ourselves. Delete all his videos.

<body>I would say we're a force for good some of the time.
Sure, we mess people up a lot, but honestly, there are so many misconceptions about the hacker community. This Grumplestiltskin guy isn't helping our case either.
He's posted a lot of videos talking about how hacker groups are ruining the world or some shit. He's even targeted us directly.
Your mission is to infiltrate WeTube's system and delete every single video Grumplestiltskin has made. Every. Single. One. I'll link you to WeTube's web node.
Good luck,
