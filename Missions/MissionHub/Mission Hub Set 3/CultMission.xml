<body>This is serious.
A cult that goes by the Order of Giygas has been wreaking havoc throughout the world. They have been going after some kind of weapon from what I can gather.
They must be stopped. If they continue, there may be dire consequences for everyone. Your mission is to investigate this cult. Take them down.
You will have to infiltrate their servers to find where the core of their network is. Find a way to disable the core, and their operations SHOULD be dismantled in some form.
I'm counting on you.
