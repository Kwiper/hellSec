<body>Guess our paths converged here. 
Take a look at this new port crusher. Holy damn, this'll be useful. There's also this IP here which might lead to the Core server. I just tried it though, it's whitelisted.
I found something else on the other proxy node that I think you might find interesting. It appears to be an IP to another whitelist server, but it just so happens to be whitelisted itself.
See if you can find a way to disable that whitelist. Maybe there's an eos device connected, or some deleted file.
