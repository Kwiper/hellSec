<body>I have an old friend who regrets doing a Bachelor's Degree in a certain subject.
Her name is Laura Nakamura, and she did a degree in Geology. Looking back, she thinks it probably wasn't the best choice for her future. Can't really blame her, though. Geology. Not a real science.
The record is up on the Universal Academic Database, but in order to get into it, you'll need a username and password. I recommend taking a look at her professor.
Find her Geology Professor, track down his account details for the Academic Database and remove her degree in Geology.

Godspeed,
