    <body>Hello, there.
My name is Z3r0. I help run the hacking collective known as hellSec. 
hellSec's mantra is to create chaos for people. But we aren't all bad, we help out those who ask us to, as well.

We at hellSec have chosen you to take part in our little cyber-crusade. 

To get initiated, you simply have to hack into the hellSec Repository and download any programs you find.

Reply to this email once you've downloaded the programs.
